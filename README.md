# SortingAppProject

This sorting app accepts integer numbers via command line, and then prints them out in ascending order.

This app can be run through the runnable jar files in "\out\artifacts\SortingAppProject_jar\SortingAppProject.jar" or 
"\target\SortingAppProject-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" as they were created by using two different approaches, namely, by building an artifact with IDE, and by using maven plugins, respectively.
